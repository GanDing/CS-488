## Manual

----

* Expand the grid area to 20 * 20 (22 * 22 in total).

* The maximum scale is bounded to 5 and the minimun sacle is bouned to 0.1 with the scale rate: 0.1 * distance of yOffset scroll.

* The rotation rate is: 0.01 * distance of mouse in the x direction.

* Max Cube per cell is bouned to 10.

* Press 'B' to enable/disable the border for each cube.

* Use 'W/S' to control rotation on x-axis with the rate +/-0.05f.

* Hold 'C' and add/remove cubes to create the same cube column on the opposite half (suppose we divide the graph to left half and right half). Allows to draw symmetric graph easily.
